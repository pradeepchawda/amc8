### Warm-up
1. Johnny has 3 boxes and Lily has 5 boxes. How many boxes do they have all together?

2. If the box in #1 contains 3 apples and 2 peaches, how many apples and peaches are there all together?

### Distribution
1. a(b+c) = ab + ac
   * 3(x-2)
   * 4x - 3(x-2)
   * = 3x - 6
   * = 4x + (-3)(x + (-2)) = 4x - 3x + (-3)(-2) = x + 6

2. (a+b)(c+d) = (a+b)c + (a+b)d = ac + bc + ad + bd
   * (2x - 3)(4x -1)
   * = (2x - 3)4x - (2x - 3) = 8x^2 - 12x -2x + 3 = 8x^2 - 14x + 3

## Difference of Squares
* a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)
   * (a - 5)(a + 5)
   * (2a - 9)(2a + 9)

## Perfect Squares
* (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
   * (6x - 5y)^2 = (6x)^2 + 2(6x)(-5y) + (-5y)^2 = 36x^2 - 60xy + 25y^2

## Sum of Reciprocals
* given ab and a+b, the sum of their reciprocals 1/a + 1/b = b/ab + a/ab = (a+b)/(ab)
   * A square has an area of 50 cm^2. The length is increased by 4cm and the width decreased by 4cm. What is the area of the resulting rectangle?
      * a*a = 50, (a+4)(a-4) = a^2 - 16 = 50 - 16 = 34
   * if ab = 7, bc = 5 and a + c = 4, what is a + b + c?
      * 7 + 5 = ab + bc = b(a+c) = 4b ==> 4b = 12 ==> b = 3, so a+b+c = 4+3 = 7
