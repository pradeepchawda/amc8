### Warm-up
1. Find the area of one rectangle. Cut the rectangle into two small rectangles and calculate the areas for the two small ones

2. Calculate 7*103 in your head.

### Distribution Property
1. a(b + c) = ab + ac

2. Simplify 4x - 3(x -2)

3. Simplify 3a - 4(2 - a)

4. Simplify 8x -(3 + 5x)

### Distribution with Polynomials

1. (2 + 3)(7 + 5) = 5*12 = 60, or 2*7 + 2*5 + 3*7 + 3*5 = 60

2. (a + b)(c + d)

3. (2x - 3)(4x -1)

4. (2x - 3y)(4x - 2y -5)

### Special Product
1. (a - 5)(a + 5)

2. (x - 5)^2

3. (6x + 7)(6x - 7)

4. (3x + 1)^2

5. (xy - 4)^2

### Difference of Sequares
1. (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2

2. (6x + 5y)(6x - 5y) = ?

### Perfect Sequares
1. (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

2. (6x - 5y)^2 = (6x)^2 + 2(6x)(-5y) + (-5y)^2 = 36x^2 - 60xy + 25y^2

### Sum of Reciprocals
1. Given ab and a+b, find the sum of their reciprocals of two numbers a and b

   1/a + 1/b = b/ab + a/ab = (a + b)/(ab)

2. A square has an area of 50 cm^2, The length is increase by 4cm and the width is decresed by 4cm. What is the area of the resulting rectangle?

   x*x = 50, what is (x+4)(x-4)?

3. The sum of two numbers is five and their product is two. What is the sum of the square of the two numbers

   a + b = 5, ab = 2, what is a^2 + b^2? --> a^2 + b^2 + 2ab - 2ab --> (a+b)^2 - 2ab
