<h2>Session03 - Examples</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Warm-up</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Johnny has 4 times <em>as much as</em> Danny does. If Danny has 10 candies, how many candies does Johnny have?</p></li>
<li><p>True of False? Five is <em>25% more</em> than four, therefore four is <em>25% less</em> than five</p></li>
<li><p>In a bag, there are pennies and nickels in the ratio of 1:2. How much money is in the bag?</p>

<ul>
<li>(A) $1.11</li>
<li>(B) $1.21</li>
<li>(C) $1.31</li>
<li>(D) $1.41</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3>Ratio &amp; Percent</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Ratio: relationship between two quantities, in fraction or m:n</p></li>
<li><p>Percent: part-to-whole ratio, where the whole is 100</p></li>
<li><p>The following statements represent the same relationship:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ratio of girls to boys is <em>3:2</em></li>
<li><em>3/5</em> of the students are girls</li>
<li><em>60%</em> of the students are girls</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>108 coins are made of pennies, nickels, and quarters in the ratio of 2:3:4. How many pennies and quarters?</p>

<ul>
<li>2/9 are pennies  =&gt; 108 * (2/9) = <em>24</em></li>
<li>4/9 are quarters =&gt; 108 * (4/9) = <em>48</em></li>
<li>3/9 are nickels  =&gt; 108 * (3/9) = <em>36</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Adam has 3 different sizes of backpacks. winter pack, summer pack, and day pack. day pack is half of summer pack in size; 5 summer packs can hold the same amount of stuff as that in 3 winter packs. Adam has 6 full winter pack stuff, but he has only day packs. How many day packs does he need?</p>

<ul>
<li>w:s:d = 3:5:10</li>
<li>6:10:20 therefore <em>20</em></li>
<li><em>see warm-up #3, what is the solution difference?</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3>Proportion</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Two ratios are proportional if they are equal, e.g. 1/2 = 50/100</p></li>
<li><p>In a proportion, cross-products are always equal, e.g. 1/4 = 25/100 ==&gt; 1<em>100 = 4</em>25, a/b = x/y ==&gt; ay = bx</p></li>
<li><p>Tom drafted a construction blue print. The scale of the blueprint is 1/4 inch = 1 foot. If window width on the blueprint is 2 inches long. What is the window width?</p>

<ul>
<li>(1/4):1 = 2 : x</li>
<li>(1/4)<em>x = 1</em>2 ==&gt; x = 8</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h3>Percent of Change</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>The change to the original amount expressed in a percent</p></li>
<li><p>Johnny has $10. He spent (reduced) 30% of it on a cup of drink. Negative 30% change.</p></li>
<li><p>Johnny now has $7 left. In order to get back to the original $10. How many percentage increase that he needs?</p>

<ul>
<li>7 + 7*x% = 10</li>
<li>7(1+x) = 10 =&gt; x = 10/7 - 1 ==&gt; x = 42.8%</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
