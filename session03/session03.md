### Warm-up
1. Johnny has 4 times *as much as* Danny does. If Danny has 10 candies, how many candies does Johnny have?

2. True of False? Five is *25% more* than four, therefore four is *25% less* than five

3. In a bag, there are pennies and nickels in the ratio of 1:2. How much money is in the bag?
   * (A) $1.11
   * (B) $1.21
   * (C) $1.31
   * (D) $1.41
   
### Ratio & Percent
1. Ratio: relationship between two quantities, in fraction or m:n

2. Percent: part-to-whole ratio, where the whole is 100

3. The following statements represent the same relationship:
   * The ratio of girls to boys is *3:2*
   * *3/5* of the students are girls
   * *60%* of the students are girls

4. 108 coins are made of pennies, nickels, and quarters in the ratio of 2:3:4. How many pennies and quarters?
   * 2/9 are pennies  => 108 * (2/9) = *24*
   * 4/9 are quarters => 108 * (4/9) = *48*
   * 3/9 are nickels  => 108 * (3/9) = *36*
 
5. Adam has 3 different sizes of backpacks. winter pack, summer pack, and day pack. day pack is half of summer pack in size; 5 summer packs can hold the same amount of stuff as that in 3 winter packs. Adam has 6 full winter pack stuff, but he has only day packs. How many day packs does he need?
   * w:s:d = 3:5:10
   * 6:10:20 therefore *20*
   * *see warm-up #3, what is the solution difference?*

### Proportion
1. Two ratios are proportional if they are equal, e.g. 1/2 = 50/100

2. In a proportion, cross-products are always equal, e.g. 1/4 = 25/100 ==> 1*100 = 4*25, a/b = x/y ==> ay = bx

3. Tom drafted a construction blue print. The scale of the blueprint is 1/4 inch = 1 foot. If window width on the blueprint is 2 inches long. What is the window width?
   * (1/4):1 = 2 : x
   * (1/4)*x = 1*2 ==> x = 8

### Percent of Change
1. The change to the original amount expressed in a percent

2. Johnny has $10. He spent (reduced) 30% of it on a cup of drink. Negative 30% change.

3. Johnny now has $7 left. In order to get back to the original $10. How many percentage increase that he needs?
   * 7 + 7*x% = 10
   * 7(1+x) = 10 => x = 10/7 - 1 ==> x = 42.8%
