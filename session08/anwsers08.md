1. A soccer team has jerseys numbered from 10 to 30. Everyone on the team gets a jersey and there are three left over. How many players are on the team?
   * 30 - 10 + 1 jerseys - 3 extra = 18

2. How many three digit whole numbers are there?
   * 100 to 999 inclusive: 999 - 100 + 1 = 900

3. The circumference of a circular table is 30 feet. If a set of silverware is placed every three feet around the circumference of the table, how many place-settings are there?
   * 30 feet total length / 3 feet per set = 10 gaps
   * tip: 30 feet long, one inclusive, one exclusive.

4. At the pound there are 40 dogs. If 22 dogs have spots and 30 dogs have short hair, what is the fewest number of dogs that can have short hair and spots?
   * 40 dogs
   * 22 with spots + 30 with short hair = 52 --> 52 - 40 = 12 double counted due to the fact that these dogs have both short hair and spots.

bonus question:
* Ten friends go out to dinner together: 7 order an appetizer, 5 order a soup, and 4 order a salad. If everyone orders something, but no one orders exactly two things, how many people order all three things?
   * 7 appetizer, 5 soup, 4 salad
   * 7 + 5 + 4 = 16 items, but we have only 10 people
   * 6 extra items are part of orders that contains three items, hence 3 people order all three items
