</ul>

<ul>
<li>Organize counting problems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Session08 - warm-up</h2>

<ul>
<li>Homework assignments are: problem 10 through 20. How many homework are there?</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h4>General counting rules</h4>

<ul>
<li>How many positive integers are between a and b exclusive where the number is less than b?
<ul>
<li>inclusive: (b-a) + 1</li>
<li>exclusive: (b-a) - 1</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Avoid double counting</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Johnny's father owns a rectangle plot of land that is 60 yards long and 30 yards wide. If he places a fence post at each corner and posts are placed every three yards,</p>

<ol>
<li>how many fence posts will there be on long and short sides?</li>
<li>how many fence posts will he need to enclose his land?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>tip1: for question 1, consider gaps between posts. 60 yards long, post at every 3 yards, that means 20 gaps. Once the first post is placed, for each 3 yard gap, we need a post. So total 21 posts. Using the same approach, the short side needs 11 posts.</p></li>
<li>tip2: for question 2, how many shared connection points? those shared points would have been double counted if we simply add the posts needed for all four sides.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Venn Diagrams</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>In a soccer league, 19 students have a brother, 15 have a sister, 7 have both a brother and a sister, and 6 students don't have any siblings at all. How many students are in the league?</p>

<ol>
<li>19 have a brother - 7 have both a brother and a sister = 12 only have a brother</li>
<li>15 have a sister - 7 have both a brother and a sister = 8 only have a brother</li>
<li>7 have both a brother and a sister</li>
<li>6 have neither a brother or a sister</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>On a survey of 40 Miller middle-school students, 14 students said that they like basketball, 18 students like tennis, and 11 student do not like basketball nor tennis. How many students like both basketball and tennis?</p>

<ol>
<li>11 like neither --> 29 students must like at least one sport.</li>
<li>14 like basketball</li>
<li>18 like tennis</li>
<li>14+18 = 32 students. If each of 29 student like one sport, that would 29 students, so 3 (32-29) must be counted twice, one for basketball, and one for tennis.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h4>Three-Set Venn Diagrams</h4>

<ul>
<li>Every student who applied for admission to a summer veterinary school has at least one pet: 30 have a cat, 28 have a dog, and 26 have fish. If 13 students have fish and a cat, 15 stduent have fish and a dog, 11 student have both a cat and a dog, and 4 students have a cat, a dog, and fish. How many students applied to veterinary school?
<ol>
<li>30 (cat) + 28 (dog) + 26 (fish) = 84 owners</li>
<li>tip: students owning two pets are double counted. 84 - 13 - 15 - 11 = 45 owners</li>
<li>tip: students owning three pets are substracted twice. 45 + 4 = 49 owners</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
