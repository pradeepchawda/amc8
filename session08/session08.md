#### General counting rules
   * How many positive integers are between a and b exclusive where the number is less than b?
     * inclusive: (b-a) + 1
     * exclusive: (b-a) - 1

#### Avoid double counting
   * Johnny's father owns a rectangle plot of land that is 60 yards long and 30 yards wide. If he places a fence post at each corner and posts are placed every three yards,
     1. how many fence posts will there be on long and short sides?
     2. how many fence posts will he need to enclose his land?

   * tip1: for question 1, consider gaps between posts. 60 yards long, post at every 3 yards, that means 20 gaps. Once the first post is placed, for each 3 yard gap, we need a post. So total 21 posts. Using the same approach, the short side needs 11 posts.
   * tip2: for question 2, how many shared connection points? those shared points would have been double counted if we simply add the posts needed for all four sides.


#### Venn Diagram
   * In a soccer league, 19 students have a brother, 15 have a sister, 7 have both a brother and a sister, and 6 students don't have any siblings at all. How many students are in the league?
     1. 19 have a brother - 7 have both a brother and a sister = 12 only have a brother
     2. 15 have a sister - 7 have both a brother and a sister = 8 only have a brother
     3. 7 have both a brother and a sister
     4. 6 have neither a brother or a sister

   * On a survey of 40 Miller middle-school students, 14 students said that they like basketball, 18 students like tennis, and 11 student do not like basketball nor tennis. How many students like both basketball and tennis?
     1. 11 like neithers --> 29 students must like at least one sport.
     2. 14 like basketball
     3. 18 like tennis
     4. 14+18 = 32 students. If each of 29 student like one sport, that would 29 students, so 3 (32-29) must be counted twice, one for basketball, and one for tennis.

   * Every student who applied for admission to a summer veterinary school has at least one pet: 30 have a cat, 28 have a dog, and 26 have fish. If 13 students have fish and a cat, 15 stduent have fish and a dog, 11 student have both a cat and a dog, and 4 students have a cat, a dog, and fish. How many students applied to veterinary school?
     1. 30 (cat) + 28 (dog) + 26 (fish) = 84 owners
     2. tip: students owning two pets are double counted. 84 - 13 - 15 - 11 = 45 owners
     3. tip: students owning three pets are substracted twice. 45 + 4 = 49 owners
