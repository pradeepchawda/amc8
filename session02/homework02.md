1. What is the slope of the line that passes through (-9, 9) and the origin (0, 0)?

2. Find the sum of the x and y intercepts of the equation 3x - 5y = 8. Expres your answer as a common fraction in simplest terms.

3. Write the standard form equation for the line which passes through (1, -1), and (-5, -5).

4. The graph of the equation y = 2x + b passes through the point (b, -3). Find b.

5. If the graphs of the lines 2x - 5y = 7 and 10x + by = 7 are perpendicular, what is the value of b? (hint: two lines are perpendicular if the products of their slopes is -1.)
