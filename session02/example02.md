## Examples
1. make a phone call: connection fee: 20 cents; per minute charge: 10 cents. cost = 20 (connection fee) + minutes * 10 (cent/minute)

2. mobile phone data plan: $20 for the first 3GB, it's additional $15 per GB over 2GB. charge = $20 (first 3GB) + $15 * Overage


## Examples - slope-intercept form
1. slope-intercept form: y = ax + b
 
2. y = 3x + 2; rate=3; base=2

## Examples - two points
3. slope: rise over run

4. intercepts: points where line crosses and x and y-axis

1. slope = rise / run = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) = (y1-y2)/(x1-x2)

2. find the slope for a line passing (7, -2) and (-4, -1)

3. write the linear equation for a line passing (10, 3) and (-5, 9)

(y-3)/(x-10) = (9-3)/(-5-10) ==> y = (-2/5)x + 7

## Examples - Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
1. two lines with the same slope are parallel

2. two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is -1.

## Examples - Horizontal and Vertical Lines
1. horizontal: slope = 0, y is constant

2. vertical: slope (undefined), x is constant
