### Review Exercises
1. It takes 6 lumberjacks 7 minutes to saw through 8 trees. How many minutes will it take for 7 lumberjacks to saw through 8 trees?
2. A fruit stand sells apples, bananas, and pears. There are 20% more pears than apples, and the ratio of apples to bananas is 3:4. What is the fewest number of pears that could be at the fruit stand?
3. If 5% more than a is b, and b is 15% less than c, what is the ratio between a and c?
4. Three circles are tangent to each other and have as their centers the vertices of right triangle of side lengths 6, 8, and 10cm. Express the combined area of the three circles in terms of pi.
5. Today I am 6 years less than half my father's age. In 6 years, I will be 6 years ore than one-third my father's age. How old was my father when I was born?
6. Franklin rides his bicycle to the beach averaging 18mph. He rides home along the same route. What speed must he average on the way home if he wants to average 21 miles per hour for the round trip?
7. Congruent circles of radius 6 have their centers at C(5,4) and D(1,2). The circles intersect at point A and B. What is the slope-intersect form equation of the line which passes through A and B?
8. In a cage full of bugs, there are beetles (6 legs) and spiders (8 legs). There are 162 more legs than bugs and 18 more beetles than spiders. How many spiders are there?



#### answers:
1. answer
  - one lumberjack in 1 minute can saw (8/7)/6
  - 7 lumberjacks in x minutes can saw 8 trees which is 7 * (8/7)/6 x = 8
  - (8/6)x = 8 ==> x = 6

2. answer
  - a:p = 1:1.2 = 5:6
  - a:b = 3:4
  - Minimum number of apples is the least common multiple which is 15. Therefore minimum number of pears is 18.

3. answer
  - a:b = 1:1.05, b:c=0.85:1
  - a:c = 1/1.05 * 0.85/1 = 0.85/1.05 = 85/105 = 17/21

4. answer
  - let radius be a, b, and c
  - a+b = 6; b+c = 8, a+c=10;
  - #3 - #2 ==> a-b=2
  - #1 + #4 ==> 2b = 8 ==> a = 4; b = 2; and c = 6
  - pi(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = pi(16+4+36) = 56pi

5.
### Warm-up
1. Johnny has 3 boxes and Lily has 5 boxes. How many boxes do they have all together?

2. If the box in #1 contains 3 apples and 2 peaches, how many apples and peaches are there all together?

### Distribution
1. a(b+c) = ab + ac
   * 3(x-2) = 3x - 6
   * 4x - 3(x-2) = 4x + (-3)(x + (-2)) = 4x - 3x + (-3)(-2) = x + 6

2. (a+b)(c+d) = (a+b)c + (a+b)d = ac + bc + ad + bd
   * (2x - 3)(4x -1) = (2x - 3)4x - (2x - 3) = 8x^2 - 12x -2x + 3 = 8x^2 - 14x + 3

## Difference of Sequares
* a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)
   * (a - 5)(a + 5)
   * (2a - 9)(2a + 9)

## Perfect Squares
* (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
   * (6x - 5y)^2 = (6x)^2 + 2(6x)(-5y) + (-5y)^2 = 36x^2 - 60xy + 25y^2

## Sum of Reciprocals
* given ab and a+b, the sum of their reciprocals 1/a + 1/b = b/ab + a/ab = (a+b)/(ab)
   * A square has an area of 50 cm^2. The length is increased by 4cm and the width decreased by 4cm. What is the area of the resulting rectangle?
      * a*a = 50, (a+4)(a-4) = a^2 - 16 = 50 - 16 = 34
   * if ab = 7, bc = 5 and a + c = 4, what is a + b + c?
      * 7 + 5 = ab + bc = b(a+c) = 4b ==> 4b = 12 ==> b = 3, so a+b+c = 4+3 = 7
