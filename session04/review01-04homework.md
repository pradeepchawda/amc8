### Review 1.1 to 1.4 Exercises
1. It takes 6 lumberjacks 7 minutes to saw through 8 trees. How many minutes will it take for 7 lumberjacks to saw through 8 trees? (hint: problem pattern: moles dig holes)

2. A fruit stand sells apples, bananas, and pears. There are 20% more pears than apples, and the ratio of apples to bananas is 3:4. What is the fewest number of pears that could be at the fruit stand? (hint: fruits can only be a whole number, not a decimal number)

3. If 5% more than a is b, and b is 15% less than c, what is the ratio between a and c?

4. Three circles are tangent to each other and have as their centers the vertices of right triangle of side lengths 6, 8, and 10cm. Express the combined area of the three circles in terms of pi. (hint: area of circle = pi*r^2)

5. Today Johnny is 6 years less than half his father's age. In 6 years, Johnny be 6 years more than one-third his father's age. How old was his father when Johnny was born?

6. Franklin rides his bicycle to the beach averaging 18mph. He rides home along the same route. What speed must he average on the way home if he wants to average 21 miles per hour for the round trip? (hint: problem pattern: harmonic mean)

7. Congruent circles of radius 6 have their centers at C(5,4) and D(1,2). The circles intersect at point A and B. What is the slope-intersect form equation of the line which passes through A and B? (hint: the product of slopes of two perpendicular line is -1)

8. In a cage full of bugs, there are beetles (6 legs) and spiders (8 legs). There are 162 more legs than bugs and 18 more beetles than spiders. How many spiders are there?
