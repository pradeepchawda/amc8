### Permutations and Restrictions
1. How many oven 5-digit numbers contain each of digit 1 through 5?
   * first digit must be 2 or 4, hence choice of 2
   * subsequent digit have respective number of choices of 4, 3, 2, and 1
   * therefore 2*4*3*2*1 = 48 5-digit numbers
2. How many of the arrangements of all the letters in the word COUNTING contain double N?
   * once first N picked, next must be N, so treat NN as one letter
   * therefore 7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 7! = 5040
3. In how many of the arrangements of the letters in the word EXAMPLE are the letter A and M adjacent to each other?
   * combine A & M for now, there are 6! permutations
   * two E's E1xxxxxE2 = E2xxxxxE1, so 6!/2
   * AM and MA are two distinct permutations, so 6! / 2 * 2 = 6! = 720
