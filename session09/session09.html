<h3>Bowling Pins and Handshakes</h3>

<ul>
<li>How many bowling pins are setup in the standard bowling lane?
<ol>
<li>Solution 1: Find average number of pins in a row and multiple by number of rows</li>
<li>Solution 2: Arithmetic Sequence and Arithmetic Series</li>
<li>Solution 3: Think geometrically</li>
</ol></li>
<li>12 people go bowling, if everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, how many handshakes ocurred?
<ol>
<li>Solution 1: 1st person enters the room and shakes no one's hands. 2nd person shakes first person's hands (count 1). 3rd person shakes 2 person's hands, so on and so forth until the 12th person shakes 11 people's hands.</li>
<li>Solution 2: Each person shakes the other 11 people's hands. However we counted each handshake twice, since Bob shaking Bill's hands is the same as Bill shaking Bob's hands, so we have to devide the count by 2.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h3>Count Outcome - Dice and Coins</h3>

<ul>
<li>How many possible outcomes are there when
<ol>
<li>One coin is flipped</li>
<li>Two coins are flipped</li>
<li>Three coins are flipped</li>
</ol></li>
<li>How many possible outcomes are there when
<ol>
<li>One die (6-faces) is rolled</li>
<li>Two dices are rolled</li>
<li>Two coins are flipped and one die is rolled</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<h3>The fundamental counting principle</h3>

<ul>
<li>If there are m ways that one event can happen, and n ways that a second event can happen, then there are m*n ways that both events can happen.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Factorials and Permutations</h3>

<ul>
<li>How many different integers can be formed by re-arranging 4, 5, and 6?
<ol>
<li>For the first digit, there are 3 choices, namely 4, 5, and 6</li>
<li>For the second digit, since one is already gone, there are only 2 choices</li>
<li>For the third digit, there is only 1 digit left, so only 1 choice</li>
<li>Apply the fundamental counting principle, the total number of integers can be formed is 3x2x1 = 6</li>
</ol></li>
<li>How many different integers can be formed by re-arranging 4, 5, 6, and 7?
<ol>
<li>Take the same approach before, there are 4x3x2x1 = 24 possible integers formed</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Factorial: n! = n<em>(n-1)</em>(n-2)...2*1</li>
</ul>
