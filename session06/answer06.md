1. Simplify the following
   * [(x^3)^3]^3 = x^(3*3*3) = x^27
   * 48^(1/2) = (16*3)^(1/2) = 16^(1/2)*3^(1/2) = 4*3^(1/2)
   * [2(n^2)^(-2)]^2 = [2(n^(2*(-2)]^2 = [2n^(-4)]^2 = 4n^(-8) = 4/n^8
   * 48^(1/2)/15^(1/2) = (48/15)^(1/2) = (16/5)^(1/2) = 16^(1/2)/5^(1/2) = 4/5^(1/2) = 4*5^(1/2)/5

2. Solve for x if 3^x + 4^x = 2  --> a^0 = 1  --> x = 0

3. Solve for x if x^(1/6) = (5^2)^(1/3)  --> (5^2)^(1/6)^2 = (5^(2*2))^(1/6) --> x = 5^4 = 625

4. If 5^n = 2 what is the value of 25^(2n+1)? = 25^(2n)*25 = (5^2)^(2n)*25 = 5^(2*2*n)*25 = (5^n)^4*25 = 16*25 = 400
