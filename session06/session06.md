### Warm-up
1. Johnny sent a joke to three of his friends. Each of his friends in turn sent to three of their friends. And again the recipient sent to three of their friends. How many people received the joke?

2. Make a choice:

   * get a million dollars
   * get a penny on day one; for the next 30 days, your money doubles each day

### Exponents

1. repeated multiplication

2. 2*2*2*2*2 = 2^5

### Multiplication

1. 2^3 * 2^4 * 2^2 = 2^(3+4+2) = 2^9

2. rule: a^x * a^y = a^(x+y)

### Division

1. 3^6 / 3^4 = 3*3*3*3*3*3/(3*3*3*3*) = 3*3 = 3^2

2. rule: a^x / a^y = a^(x-y)

3. rule: a^0 = 1

### Negative Exponents

1. 2^3 * 2^(-3) = 2^(3-3) = 1  -->  2^(-3) = 1/(2^3)

2. rule: a^(-x) = 1/a^x

### Raising a Power to a Power

1. (2^3)^5 = (2^3)*(2^3)*(2^3)*(2^3)*(2^3) = 2^(3+3+3+3+3) = 2^(3*5)

2. rule: (a^x)^y = a^(xy)

3. simplify [(2x^4)^(-4)]^(1/4) = [2^(-4)x^(4*(-4)]^(1/4) = 2^(-4*(1/4)*x^((-16)*(1/4)) = 2^(-1)*x^(-4) = 1/(2x^4)

### Fractional Exponents

1. 9^(1/2) * 9^(1/2) = 9^(1/2+1/2) = 9  -->  9^(1/2) = 3

2. rule: a^(1/2) = √a

3. rule: a^(1/3) = 3√a

### Multiplying and Simplifying

1. a^2 * b^2 = a*a*b*b = (a*b)(a*b) = (ab)^2

2. √a * √b = √(ab)
   * a*b = √a*√a*√b*√b = (√(a*√b)(√a*√b) = (√a*√b)^2
   * √(ab) = √a*√b

### Dividing and Rationalizing

1. a^2 / b^2 = a*a / (b*b) = (a/b)(a/b) = (a/b)^2

2. √a / √b = a^(1/2) / b^(1/2) = √(a/b)
   * a/b = (√a√a)/√b√b) = (√a/√b)*(√a/√b) = (√a√b)^2
   * √(a/b) = √a*√b

3. simplify 5/(2+5^(1/2) = 5*(2-5^(1/2)/(2+5^(1/2)*(2-5^(1/2) = (10-5*5^(1/2))/(2^2-(5^(1/2)^2) = (10-5*5^(1/2)/(4-5) = 5*5^(1/2) - 10
