#### Arithmetic Sequences: a sequence where the difference between two consecutive terms is always the same.
   * 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,..., n  ( <-- difference is 1 )
   * 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11,... 2n-1   ( <-- difference is 2 )

#### Arithmetic Series: the sum of an arithmetic sequence
   * 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + n
     * let sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + (n-1) + n   ( <-- equation 1 )
     * rewrite 1 through n in reverse order so we get equation 2
     * sum = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 3 + 2 + 1   ( <-- equation 2)
     * add two equations (because if a=b and x=y, then a+x = b+y) and pair the terms
     * 2*sum = 1 + 2     + 3     + ... + (n-1) + n +
               n + (n-1) + (n-2) + ... +  2    + 1
             = (n+1) + (n+1) + (n+1) + ... + (n+1)   ( <-- repeating (n+1) n times)
             = n(n+1)

      * sun = n(n+1)/2


#### Geometric Sequences: a sequence two consecutive terms form a fixed ratio
   * 2, 4, 8, 16, ... 2^n
   * 3, 9, 27, 81, ... 3^n

#### Geometric Series: the sum of an geometric sequence
   * 2, 4, 8, 16, ... 2^n
     * let sum = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + ... + 2^(n-1) + 2^n   ( <-- equation 1 )
     * multiple 2 in both side of equation 1
     * 2sum = 4 + 8 + 16 + ... + 2^n + 2^(n+1) ( <-- equation 2)
     * subtract equation 1 from equation 2 (because if a=b and x=y, then a-x = b-y)
     * 2sum - sum = 2^(n+1) - 2
     * sum = 2^(n+1) -2
